Occasion for Lenitives; it blazes so violently at first, 'tis
like to be soon extinguish'd.</p>

<p>L. <i>Piz.</i> Dear <i>Lucy</i>, don't trifle with me; but contrive,

what this projecting Brain can do, and if you step into
the next Room, I'll soon give you an Account of my
Proceedings. <span class="ex">[<i>Exit&nbsp;L.</i>&nbsp;Pizalta.</span></p>

<p><i>Bass.</i> Ye Gods!<br />
What have I done, that you pursue me thus?<br />
Why did you e'er decree that I should wed<br />
A Wife I now must hate? Why did I see<br />
The bright <i>Aurelia</i>? Why am I thus torn<br />

<p><i>Lucy.</i> May one ask you a civil Question, and be resolv'd?</p>

prithee, a Night's Lodging? If so, pull off thy Mask, and
I'll resolve thee instantly<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>But I never strike Bargains

<p><i>Lucy.</i> I don't know, Sir, but it may tend to that, by
way of Proxy, at the long-run: But at present my Commission
reaches no further than to know your Lodgings; if
any Thing comes on't, I fancy 'twill not displease you.</p>

those Matters<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Let her be but Woman, and we

Who lives secure and free from Love's Alarms.<br />
But happier far, who, Master of himself,<br />

Oh! rigorous Laws impos'd on Free-born Man!<br />
On Man, by bounteous Nature first design'd<br />
The Sovereign Lord of all the Universe!<br />
Why must his generous Passion thus be starv'd,<br />
And be confined to one alone?<br />
The Woman, whom Heaven sent as a Relief,<br />
To ease the Burden of a tedious Life,<br />
And be enjoy'd when summon'd by Desire,<br />
Is now become the Tyrant of our Fates. [<i>Takes up a Letter.</i><br />
But hold, <i>Bassino</i>! whither does thy Passion<br />
Hurry thy wandering Reason: Let this Letter<br />
Re-call the Fugitive, and fix thy Senses<br />
On duteous Love<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>A Wife, so young, so fair,<br />
So excellent, whose Charms not three Months since<br />
Did fire thy Soul; a Wife, who dotes on thee;<br />
A Wife to whom thou sworest eternal Love<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
By Heaven, I swear again I will be true.<br />
This Thought again restores my Peace of Mind<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
No, charming Wife; no dear <i>Placentia</i>, no,<br />
Thou shalt not beg in vain: I will return [<i>Kisses the Letter.</i><br />
But who comes here&mdash;My Friend <i>Armando</i>?<br />
</p>
<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> Armando.</p>

<p>
<i>Arm.</i> Dear Friend, I heard<br />
The Conflict of your Passion, and my Joys<br />
Are now compleat, since Virtue gains the Day.</p>

<p>
<i>Bass.</i> Yes, dear <i>Armando</i>, the Conflict is o'er,<br />
And I'm resolv'd to fly to my <i>Placentia</i>.
</p>

<p>
<i>Arm.</i> Cherish that Thought: By Heaven your Resolution<br />
Transports my Soul with Joy!<br />
A kind, a virtuous Wife waits your Embraces;<br />
A Wife, who like a Turtle mourns the Absence<br />
Of her dear Mate. Haste then, my Friend, to drive<br />
That Cloud of Sorrow which o'ercasts her Mind,<br />
And, like the Sun, dispel her gloomy Thoughts.
</p>

<p><i>Bass.</i> Thanks for your Counsel<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
You like a God support my feeble Virtue.<br />
This very Morning I'll prepare for <i>Turin</i>,<br />
Where Time and Absence will deface the Image<br />
Of that bewitching Beauty, which now haunts<br />
My tortur'd Mind&mdash;Yet, first I'll take my Leave<br />
Of this fair Charmer<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>And Heaven grant<br />
That I may see her unconcern'd<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>
</p>

<p><i>Arm.</i> My Lord, what d'you mean?<br />
Have you well weigh'd the Danger of this Visit?
</p>

<p><i>Bass.</i> What danger can there be?</p>

<p><i>Arm.</i> Danger! my Lord&mdash;Consider well how feeble<br />
Our Reason is against the Pow'r of Beauty<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Bass.</i> My Resolution's firm; no Charm can shake it.<br /></p>

<p><i>Arm.</i> If not her Beauty, fear her Syren Tongue;<br />
fear her endearing Prayers, her fond Reproaches,<br />
Her tender Sighs, her Vows, her trickling Tears.<br />
Nay&mdash;if all these prove vain, fear her Despair,<br />
A Woman, an abandon'd Woman's Rage.</p>

<p><i>Bass.</i> Were there more Dangers, yet I'll stand 'em all;<br />
My Honour bids me pay this parting Visit:<br />
My Heart shall have no Share in what I'll speak.<br />
Trust me this once, and be yourself a Witness,<br />
<i>Bassino</i> can controul unlawful Love.<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>
<i>Aur.</i> No more of that&mdash;Cease thy ungrateful Suit,<br />
<i>Alonzo</i> is a Man I cannot love;<br />
I own he's witty, generous, and brave;<br />
Has all the Charms that Nature can bestow<br />
To fire a Woman's Heart<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Yet I'm insensible,<br />
His very Sight chills all my trembling Spirits;<br />
Therefore, name him no more&mdash;I charge thee do not.</p>

<p><i>Flor.</i> Madam, I've done&mdash;Yet shall I be permitted<br />
To ask a Question? Are you then resolved<br />
Ne'er to admit a Passion in your Breast?</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Oh! Dear <i>Florella</i>, press not a Confession,<br />
Which but too well my Eyes themselves disclose.<br />
Alas! I love&mdash;I love to such Excess,<br />
That tho' I know I'm lov'd again, my Mind<br />
Is still perplex'd with Doubts and jealous Fears.</p>

<p><i>Flor.</i> You love and are belov'd! Then sure you reach<br />
The Height of human Bliss, and bounteous Heaven<br />
Can scarce give more<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>But who's the happy Man;<br />
Is it not Count <i>Bassino</i>?</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Oh! charming Name; there's Musick in that Sound!<br />
Yes, Count <i>Bassino</i> is the Man I love.<br />
Canst thou now blame my Coldness to <i>Alonzo</i>?</p>

<p><i>Flor.</i> Forgive me, Madam, if I dare presume<br />
To speak my Sentiments: I must confess<br />
<i>Bassino</i> is a Man of excellent Virtue;<br />
His Education at the Court of <i>Savoy</i><br />
Has still refin'd what he receiv'd from Nature;<br />
His Person too is charming<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
And, what most Women court, he has a Title<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
But then consider, you are unacquainted<br />
With his Estate, and tho' his Equipage<br />
Denotes an ample Fortune, yet we see<br />
Many a Stranger here during the Carnival,<br />
Who makes a Figure here by industrious Gaming.<br />
As for <i>Alonzo</i>, he was born at <i>Venice</i>,<br />
Of noble Parents; his Estate, a large one<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
Even from his Youth you had his amorous Wishes,<br />
And as he grew in Years his Love increas'd:<br />
You lov'd him too<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Nay, which is more, your Father<br />
Approv'd your mutual Loves, and at his Death<br />
Bequeath'd you to <i>Alonzo</i>.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> Oh! my <i>Florella</i>, thou hast rouz'd a Thought,<br />
Which will for ever break <i>Aurelia</i>'s Rest.<br />
I know my Father's Tenderness to me<br />
Made him confirm <i>Alonzo</i>'s Suit, for then<br />
I lov'd <i>Alonzo</i><span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
But were my gentle Father still alive,<br />
I'm sure he would not cross my Inclinations,<br />
But, Oh! name not my Father; I cannot bear<br />
The sad Remembrance of so great a Loss.  <span class="ex">[<i>Weeps.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Flor.</i> But fear you not t'offend his peaceful Ghost,<br />
By breaking with the Man he destin'd yours?</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> 'Tis not my Fault: and just Heaven must forgive<br />
What Heaven decrees<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Yes, 'tis my cruel Stars<br />
That made my Heart inconstant to <i>Alonzo</i>,<br />
'Tis with Regret I break my plighted Faith;<br />
In vain I strive to check my new-born Love,<br />

<br />
<i>Enter Lady</i> Pizalta, Lucy.</p>
</div>

<p>Lady <i>Piz.</i> Did you deliver my Letter to <i>Ludovico</i>,
<i>Lucy</i>?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Madam, I did; I found him in his Study, reading
the Lover's Watch, which he swears does not at all
agree with his Constitution. He hates Injunctions of
Love, like those of Penance: For the one, says he, is
no more pleasurable to the Body, than the other beneficial
to the Soul.</p>

<p>L. <i>Piz.</i> What a fine Gallant I'm like to have with
these Principles! Well<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>what did he say to a Summons
from a Woman of my Quality? Did it not make
him wish the Time of Assignation were sooner than the
Appointment in the Letter?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> He first hum'd over your Billet; and pausing a
while, he desired me to stay for an Answer in a next
Room; then coming to me, he ask'd me what Countrywoman
you were? For, said he, if she should prove
an old Acquaintance, I would use her damnably&mdash;But
when I had assured him you never saw the Outside of
these Walls, he began to have that Desire which all Men
have to a new Face.</p>

<p>L. <i>Piz.</i> Very well; and what then?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> He strait enquir'd whether you were black,
brown, fair, old, young, Maid, Wife, or Widow? I
told him you was a wretched Wife to an old, impotent,
rich, covetous, noble <i>Venetian</i>; beautiful, young, generous,
and of a fair Complexion. He hugg'd me at
these Words, seem'd transported with the News, and
swore that in Intrigues a Wife was most suitable to
his Temper; for, said he, there's neither Children to
father, nor Honour to repair: And where his Pocket
and Liberty are safe, he is contented to venture his
Body and Soul.</p>

<p>L. <i>Piz.</i> Excellent Maxims!</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> In short, Madam, he says he has had several
Bills of this Nature drawn upon him of late, and how
much his Stock may be exhausted, he knows not; but
however he'll meet you, and if he cannot answer your
Expectation, he'll give you Earnest.</p>

<p>L. <i>Piz.</i> You talk merrily, Girl; I hope you did
not tell my Name. I should be loath to trust a Man of
his Character with my Reputation at first Dash.</p>

<p><i>Luc.</i> No, Madam, I only told your Quality.</p>

<p>L. <i>Piz.</i> That's well: Oh! Reputation, what several
Sorts of Slavery do we undergo to preserve thee! for to
be thought virtuous, we are forced to be constantly railing
against Vice, tho' our Tongues and Maxims seldom
agree.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Alas! Madam, that Pretence is grown too common:
For the Men now take it for granted, that a Lady
is very near surrendering, when once she holds out that
Flag of Defiance.</p>

<p>L. <i>Piz.</i> Well&mdash;Men use us very barbarously: They
will neither suffer us to be honest, nor allow us to be
thought so<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Here, take this Key, and secure every
thing that concerns my Reputation: And if my Husband
wakes ere I come back, you may easily find some Excuse
to prevent his Enquiries: for the Carnival allows us more
Liberty, than at other times we dare pretend to<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>I
know thy Honesty, and will rely upon't.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Yes, indeed, Madam, I am honest at the Bottom.</p>

<p>L. <i>Piz.</i> Well, I'll be gone: 'Tis about the Hour.</p>

Madam<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Oh! Lord, what shall I say, now she's

found some Business of his own, that may give my Lady
an Opportunity to mind her's.</p>

<p><i>Piz.</i> Well, <i>Lucy</i>, well,&mdash;canst thou guess my Business
now?</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> No, indeed, Sir&mdash;But I'm certain, an old
Man's Business can't be great. <span class="ex">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Lucy, aside.</i> O' my Conscience, and little too. I believe:
Yet I wish he has enough to serve my Ends. I'll

mean? I rival my Lady! Heaven forbid; I would not
injure so good a Woman for the World<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Piz.</i> Pshaw, pshaw&mdash;Where's the Injury done to her,
Child? Adod, I'll give thee a hundred Crowns.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> No Injury, say you, my Lord? Why, I wonder
you should be so jealous of my Lady, and preach such religious
Maxims to her, when your own Principles are
quite opposite.</p>

<p><i>Piz.</i> Look ye, Child, a Man may do that, which
would look abominable in a Wife<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>A Woman's
Reputation is a nice Thing<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> 'Tis so<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>and therefore 'tis but Reason I
should take Care of mine.</p>

<p><i>Piz.</i> Prithee, no more of that: Thy Reputation shall
be safe; I'll marry thee to my Gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Lucy.</i> Gentleman&mdash;Valet! Faugh&mdash;And what Good
will a hundred Crowns do me, when my Virginity is
gone? Indeed, if you lov'd me as much as you say,
and would make my Fortune, (for I should love extreamly
to be a Lady) I cannot tell how far you might
persuade me<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>I know my Reputation would be safe
in your Hands.</p>

<p><i>Piz.</i> Make thy Fortune! Why, I've known some of
our Nobles marry a Wife with less than a hundred
Crowns<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>But adod, thou'rt a charming Girl, and
therefore I'll make it a hundred Pistoles&mdash;What say'st
thou now, <i>Lucy</i>? Ah! adod, I must buss thee; [<i>Kisses her.</i>]
Ah! Rogue, methinks I'm a young, lusty, vigorous
Fellow again<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Thou shalt find I am, Girl.</p>

Well, my Lord, make it up a thousand Pistoles, and
I am your's else I'll die a Maid, I'm resolv'd.</p>

is there no way to contrive a second Meeting? For I'm
impatient till I see the dear Man again<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>The End

Hell cannot have a worse Plague in Store

tho' that's impossible, yet I may do you some little Services
to make Life's tedious Journey pleasant<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>Let
me see, I have it<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>What would you say now,

<p><i>Pla.</i> Oh! <i>Armando</i>!<br />
Thou more than Friend to the distress'd <i>Placentia</i>!<br />
Say, how shall I regain my lost <i>Bassino</i>,<br />
My false, perfidious Husband? <span class="ex">[<i>Weeps.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Arm.</i> Dear Madam, moderate your Sorrow:<br />

Mine is all Pity: You may rest secure<br />
Of all the Arguments a Friend can use<br />
To bring him back to your endearing Arms.<br />
Virtue's not quite extinguish'd in his Breast,<br />
Therefore I hope the sight of bright <i>Placentia</i><br />
Will rouze his slumb'ring Reason<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Pla.</i> Oh! <i>Bassino! Bassino!</i><br />
Oh! wretched Woman! Oh! that I had dy'd<br />
E'er I had known him false: Then I were happy:<br />
And tho' contented with his second Choice,<br />
He with a pitying Sigh, perhaps, had grac'd<br />
My Memory<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
Oh! all ye Powers that virtuous Love inspire,<br />
Assist me now: Inform my vocal Organs<br />
With angel Eloquence, such as can melt<br />
His Heart of Flint, and move his former Kindness.<br />

<p><i>Arm.</i> My Lord, <i>Armando</i>'s well,<br />

<p><i>Bass.</i> Dost thou discover aught that gives thee Cause
To doubt I am not well? Indeed I think
I am in perfect Health<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Arm.</i> My Lord, I should be glad

In which I left you last<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Bass.</i> (<i>Aside.</i>) I must dissemble now,<br />
Else I'll ne'er gain my Ends&mdash;my dear <i>Armando</i>,<br />
That Fever thou speak'st of, is now succeeded<br />
By a cold Ague-Fit: The bare Remembrance<br />
Of my unlawful Passion shakes my Soul.</p>

<p><i>Arm.</i> Such sudden Cures have often prov'd pernicious,
And we have Reason to suspect a Wound
Too quickly heal'd<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Bass.</i> Not when thou know'st what Balsam I applied.</p>

<p><i>Arm.</i> There's scarce a Balm for the deep Wounds of Love,
Besides Possession, and I cannot think
You have enjoy'd <i>Aurelia</i>.</p>

<p><i>Bass.</i> I swear I have not<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
But I enjoy my Reason, my free Reason:<br />
And who possesses that, can never cherish<br />
A Thought against himself: For such I call<br />
Whatsoever keeps me from my lawful Wife,<br />
My dear <i>Placentia</i>, to whose Arms I'll fly<br />
With all the eager Haste of a fond Bridegroom.<br />
There I shall revel in the virtuous Pleasures<br />
Of a chaste Bed&mdash;Oh! my Friend <i>Armando</i>!<br />
My dear <i>Placentia</i>'s Friend! can'st thou forgive?<br />
Indeed I'm penitent, and will offend no more.</p>

<p><i>Arm.</i> My Lord, these are the Words you spoke before:<br />
What greater Reason have I now to think<br />
You'll keep your Promise?</p>

<p><i>Bass.</i> Pride, Honour, Justice are come to my Aid,<br />
And Love too feeble to withstand 'em all,<br />
Has left the Field to my victorious Reason.<br />
Pride, with the Prospect of my future Greatness,<br />
Allures me to return with Speed to <i>Turin</i>,<br />
T'obey my Prince's Orders.<br />
Honour and Justice tell me I'm <i>Placentia</i>'s,<br />
And that <i>Aurelia</i> is <i>Alonzo</i>'s Bride.<br />
To him she gave her Virgin Vows: Nay, more,<br />
To him her dying Father did bequeath her;<br />
He loves her too, and shall not be depriv'd:<br />
My Passion is subdu'd, and I'm resolv'd<br />
Myself to give <i>Aurelia</i> to <i>Alonzo</i>.</p>

<p><i>Arm.</i> If this be true, then you are my Friend again:<br />
But how came you to learn <i>Aurelia</i>'s<br />
Engagement to <i>Alonzo</i>?</p>

<p><i>Bass.</i> I have it from himself, who an Hour since,<br />
With eager Fury sought to 'venge on me<br />
His injur'd Love, and challeng'd me to fight:<br />
I chose with Justice to defend my Life,<br />
And quit <i>Aurelia</i>, rather than to vanquish<br />
In such a Cause&mdash;<i>Alonzo</i> strait embrac'd me,<br />
Call'd me his Friend, and vow'd I should not go,<br />
Till I had seen him join'd in solemn Marriage<br />
With bright <i>Aurelia</i><span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>This I readily granted.<br />
Canst thou believe me true?</p>

<p><i>Arm.</i> My Lord, I do believe you<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span><br />
And am o'erjoy'd to hear your Resolution:<br />

Our wild Desires, than an embattl'd Foe.<br />
Now do I wish his Wife had never come. <span class="ex">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Bass.</i> <i>Armando</i>, thou'rt my Friend, and on that Score<br />

I should have waited this Return of Virtue:<br />
Or, if abandon'd, silently have mourn'd<br />
My Loss, without upbraiding my lov'd Lord,<br />
All this I should have done, but mighty Love,<br />
Too powerful for Duty to withstand,<br />

And I'm o'er paid for all my Sorrows past.<br />

<p><i>Arm.</i> Madam, I told you Virtue<br />
Was struggling in his Breast; and that it might<br />
O'ercome his vicious Love, I thought your Presence<br />
Was requisite<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>And now, my Lord, I hope<br />
You will forgive me, since all the Endeavours<br />
I us'd before had been in vain. I once<br />
Design'd to let <i>Aurelia</i> know your Marriage;<br />
But then perhaps she would not have believ'd me:<br />
Let this plead my Excuse in sending for <i>Placentia</i><br />
Without your Knowledge.</p>

<p><i>Bass.</i> I must not let him see I am concern'd.      <span class="ex">[<i>Aside.</i></span><br />
I know 'twas Friendship all, well-meaning Friendship:<br />
I only am to blame: But I'll retrieve<br />
My Credit in your Heart, and still deserve<br />

Shalt ne'er have Cause to doubt my constant Love.</p>

<p><i>Pla.</i> Oh! my <i>Bassino</i>! this Excess of Kindness<br />
Exalts me o'er all Mortals, if you're true,<br />
There's not a Blast within the Power of Fortune<br />

I know he loves thee, and therefore 'tis brave<br />
Revenge to let him see thy dying Pangs:<br />
Thy parting Sighs will rack him worse than Hell.</p>

<p><i>Aur.</i> His Wife! Oh! Insolence!<br />
In vain you waste your Breath, it moves not me:<br />
So much I love him, so much I'm belov'd,<br />
That should an Angel from yon Heaven descend,<br />

Kill me if you dare&mdash;He will revenge my Death:<br />

Oh! that I ne'er had seen the charming Fair!</p>

<p><i>Arm.</i> The Gods are just in all their Punishments:<br />
And by this single Act, we plainly see<br />
That Vengeance always treads on Perjury;<br />
And tho' sometimes no Bolts be at us hurl'd,<br />
Whilst we enjoy the Pleasures of this World;<br />
Yet a Day awaits, a Day of general Doom,<br />
When guilty Souls must to an Audit come;<br />
Then that we may not tremble, blush, or fear,<br />
Let our Desires be just; our Lives unsullied here.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
